_**Mailbox Alert System**_

**Overview**
The Mailbox Alert System is an IoT project built in C++ on the ESP32 that automatically notifies users when outgoing mail has been picked up. A button sensor detects mailbox activity, and the ESP32 sends an email alert in real time.
This project showcases skills in embedded systems, networking, and software design, while applying Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) principles to ensure reliability.

**Key Features**
Real-time email notifications when mail is collected
Wi-Fi enabled with ESP32 microcontroller
Designed with low-power efficiency for long-term use
Applied Design for Six Sigma methodology for robust system performance
Hands-on experience with embedded C++ and IoT hardware

**My Role**
Project Manager â€“ led the design, testing, and deployment process
Implemented the embedded C++ code for ESP32 integration
Managed project milestones and ensured Six Sigma design principles were followed

**Future Enhancements**
Mobile app notifications (push/SMS)
Solar-powered ESP32 for sustainability
Secure, encrypted email transmission
